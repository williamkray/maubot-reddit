this is a simple plugin for maubot that fetches a random link or image from a subreddit, and posts it to matrix for you.

install it like any other maubot plugin, and swing on over to the config file. there you can set a few options like:

  - default subreddit to use if no subreddit is supplied in the argument
  - the trigger word to use (default is reddit)
  - whether to allow NSFW content

to use it, run your bot and use your trigger. so using default configs, it would look like this:

`!reddit funny`

to fetch a random post from the r/funny subreddit.

use a different trigger and default subreddit config for multiple instances to have shortcuts to subreddits you frequent
without getting duplicate responses in the same room!
